# üß† Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques to predict whether a person has Parkinson‚Äôs Disease based on diagnostic biomarkers. Parkinson‚Äôs is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by tremors, stiffness, and slowed movements. While there's no definitive test for diagnosis, ML models can help make accurate predictions based on patterns in medical data.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source**: Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Dataset (includes 755 features and 3 observations per patient).
- **Format**: CSV  
- **Size**: 252 aggregated patient records after processing.

---

## üß∞ Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy` ‚Äî Data manipulation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` ‚Äî Data visualization  
- `scikit-learn` ‚Äî ML algorithms and preprocessing  
- `xgboost` ‚Äî Gradient boosting classifier  
- `imbalanced-learn` ‚Äî Oversampling techniques  
- `tqdm` ‚Äî For progress bars

## üìä Project Workflow

### 1. Data Import and Exploration

- Loaded dataset using `pandas`
- Used:
  - `df.info()`
  - `df.describe()`
  - `df.isnull().sum()`  
- ‚úÖ **No missing values**

---

### 2. Data Wrangling

- Aggregated multiple entries per patient using:
  ```python
  df.groupby('id').mean().reset_index()
````

* Removed `id` column
* Removed features with high correlation (`corr > 0.7`)
* ‚úÖ **Features reduced from 755 ‚Üí 287**

---

### 3. Feature Selection

* Normalized features with `MinMaxScaler()`
* Selected top 30 features using `SelectKBest(chi2, k=30)`
* Final shape:

  ```python
  df.shape  # (252, 31)
  ```

---

### 4. Handling Class Imbalance

* Visualized imbalance using pie chart

* Used `RandomOverSampler()` from `imblearn` to balance the classes:

  ```python
  ros = RandomOverSampler(sampling_strategy=1.0)
  X_resampled, y_resampled = ros.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
  ```

* ‚úÖ Final training data: **302 samples (151 healthy / 151 unhealthy)**

---

### 5. Model Training

Trained three classifiers:

* `LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced')`
* `XGBClassifier()`
* `SVC(kernel='rbf', probability=True)`

Evaluated using ROC AUC Score:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

for model in models:
    model.fit(X_resampled, y_resampled)
    ...
    print("ROC AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_val, model.predict(X_val)))
```

‚úÖ **Best performance:** Logistic Regression (least overfitting)

---

### 6. Model Evaluation

**Confusion Matrix (Logistic Regression):**

* TP = 35
* TN = 10
* FP = 4
* FN = 2

**Classification Report:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report(y_val, models[0].predict(X_val)))
```

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Precision and recall were strong for healthy class.
* üîß Improvement needed in unhealthy class recall.

---

## üìå Key Takeaways

* Logistic Regression provided the best generalization.
* Feature selection greatly reduced overfitting risk.
* Handling class imbalance was **crucial** for fair modeling.

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements

* Use hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV)
* Try ensemble or deep learning models
* Expand dataset for generalization

---
